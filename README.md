# Project2
EGR327 REST API Project with MySQL
***
This project is a part of my Software Construction Course. Using REST API, Spring Services, and a SQL database, it is implemented with Google Cloud
Platform services to get, add, update, and delete vehicles from the created vehicle inventory.

The project relies on the DAO (Data Access Object) which allows the Java code of the project interact with the SQL database with persist and merge methods for corresponding HTTP requests.
